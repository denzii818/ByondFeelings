# 第14章 了解你自己

独立思考以下目录的问题：

​      哪些类型的情形看起来显示出我最好和最坏的品质？

3．在多大程度上我对真实情况的观察是合理的？

4．我是如何仔细地把传闻、谣言和事实分开的？

​      如何把已知的与假定或猜测进行区分？对我而言，说“我不知道”有多难？

6．我在多大程度上认为“我的更好”？这种思维在哪些方面影响我对个人问题和公众议题的看法？

​       它在多大程度上影响了我倾听那些不同意我观点的人的能力、我控制自己情感的能力

​      和我改变自己的想法并修改一个判断的意愿？

7．在哪些事情上，我倾向于假定得太多，把太多的东西当作理所当然的？

8．我在多大程度上倾向于要么/要么观念，期望正确的答案总是极端的而决不是中庸的？

9．我对什么或谁感到最强烈的遵从的冲动？在哪些情况下，这种遵奉习俗冲动的倾向干扰了我的判断？

​        相对主义者？我的性格倾向在哪些方面妨碍我发展成为批判的思考者？

11．在哪些问题上我对变化的偏见最大？我过分地接受改变还是过分地抵制它？

​         这种倾向的原因是什么，我如何能最好地控制它？

12．在哪些情况下，我试图证明自己的偏见而不是控制它们？哪些情况下我以逢迎自己偏见的方式去解释证据？

14．我在多大程度上倾向于跳跃到结论？我在某些领域更倾向于如此吗？如果有，那是哪个领域？

​        我完全为了方便而草率得出结论吗？我受到听起来有权威性和令人印象深刻的欲望所驱使吗？

15．我过度概括到什么程度？我最容易接受哪些类型的刻板成见？种族的？宗教的？族群的？

16．我在多大程度上过度简单化复杂的事情？我只是不愿费力从复杂性上了解真理

​        还是我感觉受到不简明的答案所威胁？是什么使我这样？

17．我经常犯哪些表达的错误？我推论如果B跟随在A之后，那A必定是B的原因吗？

​       我为了避免困难或尴尬的讨论而转移议题吗？我自相矛盾，作循环论证，作出无意义的陈述吗？

​        我把真实的权威与虚假的权威相混淆吗？我作出错误类比吗？我运用非理性的诉求吗？

18．下列哪种错误最能体现我对质疑和批评自己观点的说法作出反应的特征：自动拒绝？转移举证责任？

​         “稻草人”做法？攻击批评者而不是讨论问题？



# Knowing Yourself

Part One of this book, “The Context,” presented the fundamental “tools and rules” involved in critical thinking. Part Two, “The Pitfalls,” explained the many ways in which thinking can go wrong and what you can do to avoid them. Part Three presents a step-by-step approach for you to use in addressing issues. Following this approach will enable you to smoothly and effectively integrate the habits and skills you have learned. Thinking, remember, is an active use of the mind, a performance activity, every bit as much as is playing tennis or the piano, driving a car, or cooking Thanksgiving dinner. The quality lies in the doing. 



Western philosophy virtually began with Socrates’ advice “Know thy- self.” Ever since, thoughtful men and women have realized that knowing oneself is the key to wisdom. As Sidney J. Harris observed, “Ninety percent of the world’s woe comes from people not knowing themselves, their abilities, their frailties, and even their real virtues. Most of us go almost all the way through life as complete strangers to ourselves.” No doubt Scottish poet Robert Burns had this reality in mind when he longed for the gift "to see ourselves as others see us. 



1. Exactly what influences have shaped my identity? How have they done so? How has my self-image been affected? In what situations am I less an individual because of these influences? 
2. In what ways am I like the good thinker (as outlined in Chapter 2)? In what ways like the poor thinker? What kinds of situations seem to bring out my best and worst qualities? 
3. To what extent has my perspective on truth been reasonable? (Refer to Chapter 3 if necessary.) 
4. How careful am I about separating hearsay and rumor from fact? About distinguishing the known from assumptions or guesses? How difficult is it for me to say “I don’t know”? 
5. How consistent am I in taking the trouble to make my opinions informed? 
6. To what extent do I think that “mine is better” (not only the personal “mine” but the ethnocentric “mine” as well)? In what ways has this kind of thinking affected my view of personal problems and public issues? To what extent does it affect my ability to listen to those who disagree with me? My ability to control my emotions? My willing- ness to change my mind and revise a judgment? 
7. In what matters am I inclined to assume too much, take too much for granted? 
8. To what degree do I tend to have the either/or outlook, expecting that the right answer will always be extreme and never moderate? 
9. To what or to whom do I feel the strongest urge to conform? In what situations has this conformist tendency interfered with my judgment? 
10. Do I tend to be an absolutist, demanding that truth be neat and simple, or a relativist, claiming that everyone creates his or her own truth? In what ways has my characteristic tendency hindered my development as a critical thinker? 
11. In what matters am I most biased toward change? Am I overly accepting of change or overly resistant to it? What is the cause of this tendency and how can I best control it? 
12. In what situations do I seek to confirm my biases rather than control them? In what situations do I interpret evidence in a way that flatters my bias? 
13. How often do I approach issues with a double standard, overlooking flaws in arguments that agree with mine and nitpicking those that disagree? 
14. To what extent do I tend to jump to conclusions? Do I tend to do so more in certain areas? If so, which? Do I draw my conclusions pre- maturely purely for the sake of convenience? Am I motivated by the desire to sound authoritative and impress people? 
15. To what extent do I overgeneralize? What kinds of stereotypes do I most readily accept? Racial? Religious? Ethnic? 
16. To what extent do I oversimplify complex matters? Am I simply un- willing to take the trouble to learn the truth in its complexity? Or do I feel threatened by answers that are not neat and tidy? What has made me this way? 
17. What errors of expression do I most often commit? Reasoning that if B follows A, A must be the cause of B? Shifting the issue to avoid difficult or embarrassing discussions? Contradicting myself? Arguing in a circle? Making meaningless statements? Confusing real with bogus authorities? Making false analogies? Using irrational appeals? 
18. Which of the following errors are most characteristic of my responses to challenges and criticism of my ideas: automatic rejection? shifting the burden of proof? straw man? attacking the critic rather than dis- cussing the issue? 



humans are prone to avoid focusing on and coping with their problems and instead often sweep them under the rug by resorting to rationalization, denial, compensation, identification, projection, avoid- ance, repression, and other defensive maneuvers
