# 第7章  什么是论证

- 论证是什么，不是什么

  在本书中，论证不是指吵架，不是指两个或更多人之间的意见交流，

  而是支持一个判断的推理思路。

- 论证基本原则

  > 1 前提要么真 ，要么假 （正确或不正确）
  >
  > 2 衔接前提与结论的推理要么有效 ，要么无效 
  >
  > 3 正确的前提加上有效的推理等于合理的论证
  >
  > 4 不正确的前提，或者是无效的推理将使得一个论证是不合理的 

- 如何分析一个论证：步骤是什么？

# **Argument** 论证

One common meaning is “a quarrel,” as in the sentence “They had a heated argument, a real scream-ing match.”Another meaning of argument is “the exchange of opinions between two or more people,” as occurs in a formal debate.

Although argument as “the exchange of opinions between two or more people” is relevant to critical thinking, another meaning of the term is even more relevant to the challenge of becoming a critical thinker.Argument, in this sense, means the line of reasoning that supports a judgment.Because our main concern in this chapter, as throughout this book, is **the evaluation of individual arguments（独立论证的评估）**, your own as well as other people’s, this definition is the one we will focus on.



**The basic principles** 基本原则

1. The premises are either true or false (correct or incorrect).1 前提要么真 ，要么假 （正确或不正确）
2. The reasoning that links the premises to the conclusion is either valid or invalid . 2 衔接前提与结论的推理要么有效 ，要么无效 
3. Correct premises plus valid reasoning equal a sound argument.3 正确的前提加上有效的推理等于合理的论证
4. Either an incorrect premise or invalid reasoning will render an argument unsound.4 不正确的前提，或者是无效的推理将使得一个论证是不合理的 

The basic approach to evaluating arguments can be stated simply: Decide whether the premises are true or false and whether the reasoning that leads from them to the conclusion is valid. If both criteria are met, the argument is sound. When the argument is clearly and fully stated and you ask the right questions, this approach is relatively easy to follow.

Argument = premise+ reasoning+conclusion  **论证 = 前提 + 推理 + 结论**

Good Argument = correct premise+ effective reasoning+reasonable Conclusion 

**for example**

**The Argument**：Success comes to those who work hard.Jane is successful.

​                             Therefore, Jane worked hard.

**Premise**：Success comes to those who work hard. Jane is successful.

**Reasoning**: because Success comes to those who work hard and Jane is successful

**Conclusion**：Therefore, Jane worked hard.





The Questions ：Does it always?

The Questions ：Is she?

The Questions ：Does this conclusion follow logically from what is stated in the premises? 

​                             Would any other conclusion be as reasonable?



Comment: The first premise is not entirely true. Some people who work hard end up failing anyway because they lack the necessary aptitude or background experience to meet the challenge. Moreover, some people who do not work hard succeed anyway because they have wealth and/or influence. Even if we grant that the second premise is true, the argument must still be judged unsound because of the first premise.



When an argument contains hidden premises, identify them before proceeding with your evaluation. Hidden premises are clearly implied ideas that are not recognized when the argument is conceived and expressed. When the hidden premise is accurate, no harm is done; but when it is inaccurate, it quietly corrupts the argument. Following are some examples of such arguments. Each is presented first as it might occur in informal discussion. Then it is broken down into its component parts, including hidden premises.

Argument: They should never have married—they felt no strong physical attraction to each other during courtship.



The Component Parts

Stated Premise: They felt no strong physical attraction to each other

Hidden Premise: Strong physical attraction is the best, or perhaps

​                              the only meaningful basis for marriage

Reasoning：Because they felt no strong physical attraction to each other during courtship.

Conclusion: They should never have married.



The Questions ： Did they feel no strong physical attraction to each other？

The Questions ： Is strong physical attraction is the best, or perhaps the only meaningful basis for marriage?

 The Questions ：Do the premises lead to this conclusion and no other?

### 作业：论证“根本就不该建核电厂，因为核电厂里那些危险的核废料会污染环境”的隐蔽假设是什么？试着应用反面立场的方式找出来。

答：

### 结论：不该建核电厂！
前提（理由）：因为核电厂里有危险的核废料会污染环境。
推理：因为有核废料，所以就不该建核电厂。
隐蔽的前提（假设）：核废料一定是有危险的，而有危险的废料就会污染环境。

### 反面立场：
核废料虽然危险也有污染环境的可能，但还是可以建核电厂。因为核电厂不消耗自然资源，发电效率高、机组容量大，并且不会对环境排放其他如火电厂不可避免的二氧化碳、二氧化硫等空气污染物，而对于核废料经过合理、有效的技术处理之后可以完全避免！
